                    <p>This is an interactive demo of an example escape room level. You can look around in 360 degrees by clicking on the room and dragging your mouse. This simulates how a player will look around a room when moving their head while using a VR headset. There are objects within the room that you can click on to to read more information about how users playing the game will interact within the room. In a typical level, players would be able to move around the room and approach objects by using directional buttons on their controller to walk around the room. If the user has a room-scale VR setup such as the Vive, the movement of the player can be controlled by tracking their movement within their physical room. As you look around the room and interact with objects, keep in mind that the goal of this project using VR is to build upon the conceptual model of keeping the controls as natural as possible to mimic how a player would interact with a room in the real world.</p>
                    <p>The rooms would contain a variety of objects that the player could interact with, such as items they can pick up and put in their inventory, switches that they can turn on or off, keypads that they can enter a code on, and clues that help them solve puzzles. To interact with an object, the user points their controller at it and pulls the trigger. Interactable objects are highlighted by the game, to make them easier to spot. To store an object in their inventory, they must first use the ‘interact’ button to pick it up. While pressing the select button after picking up an object lets you examine it more closely, pressing the select and interact buttons, simultaneously allows you to store the item in your inventory.</p>

                <div class="page-content">
                    <p>Story mode is composed of a set of sequential room challenges to complete. The rooms become more difficult as each one is completed. What’s more, items collected in earlier rooms may be needed in order to complete later challenges. Players may move backwards through rooms without having to re-do the previous challenges.They may not evidently, move forward without completing the current challenge.</p>
                    <p>Within each room, a procedural series of actions must be performed in order to escape. When each of these milestones is completed, this progress is saved, in addition to the current state of the player’s inventory, which tracks the items they have collected up to that point. When the game is exited and then restored, it will return to the point immediately following the completion of the most recent milestone. These milestone steps can be skipped (auto completed by the game), advancing the game, through the expenditure of credits (see Options). These ‘skips’ are not equivalent to hint; when these steps are completed, nothing is seen on the user’s end.They do not get to understand the puzzle solving aspects of the portion they have skipped over; the necessary steps to complete that subtask are simply completed and the items that would have been collected appear in the player’s inventory.</p>
                    <p>Upon completion of any room, the player’s view will be replaced by a black screen where they will be updated on any credits earned or objects gained in their inventory through completion of the level.At this point, they will also be given the option to quit or continue the game. If they choose to continue, when the screen resolves, their view will be configured to be the center of the new room. </p>

                <div class="page-content">
                    <p>Puzzle mode allows the user to choose from a set of  puzzle rooms, different from those in story mode, to solve. Each of these rooms is designed to be able to be completed independently; all puzzle rooms are mutually exclusive in that no item other than those loaded into inventory when the room is launched, are needed to complete it.</p>
                    <p>
                    Puzzle rooms may be played in single or multiplayer mode. Single player puzzle is has a format identical to that of story mode. Multiplayer mode remotely connects players over the internet. Teams of up to five can either be chosen by providing all players’ unique identification, or randomly assigned from a pool of waiting users. The goal of multiplayer mode is to work together to complete the puzzles. The game state is synchronized between all the players, so whenever someone makes progress on a puzzle or finds a new item, everyone will see the effects of that. This format means that there is no support for competitive gameplay. In multiplayer, all players share the same inventory and can access those items at any time, even if someone else is using them. Any time one player obtains an item, all other players may immediately use that item as well. There is no risk of conflicts occurring between the devices, because each item only has one possible use; if both players “use up” an item at the same time, it doesn’t matter because the end result is always the same no matter who used it.</p>
                    <p>Puzzle mode rooms are all independent, therefore upon completion, the user’s view will be replaced by a black completion screen that updates them on the number of credits earned and expended during that level.They will then be transported back to the Puzzle mode gameplay menu.</p>

From here, the player may view a global leaderboard and choose to add their own best times to the global leaderboard. This gives players a reward for completing puzzles without skipping them and lets them compete with other players.</p>

The first two are incremental sliders while the latter two are simple on/off toggle switches. Below the stream switch is an option button ‘configure streaming’. If the settings for streaming have not been initially set, the game will not allow the user to toggle streaming ‘on’.</p>
                    <h3>Brightness</h3>
                    <p>The brightness option allows the user to adjust the brightness if the screen and the sound slider allows the user to adjust the volume level between mute and max volume.</p>
                    <h3>Volume</h3>
                    <p>The volume option will allow the user to adjust how loud the game volume is. This is a global option for all of the sounds within the game: background, interactions, and any other sounds available.</p>
                    <h3>Skipping</h3>
                    <o>Enabling the use of credits permits the user to use credits to bypass steps in a given room to hasten its completion, or to extend the allocated time limit by 30 second increments. Credits are earned automatically upon the completion of rooms, but can also be purchased with real money through the game’s website. All the user has to do is log in using their unique player id (See streaming) and provide a method of payment. Credits reside in the player’s inventory. Credits earned through the completion of Story mode challenges may only be then in turn used in story mode ; the same is true of Puzzle mode credits.</p>
                    <h3>Streaming</h3>
                    <p>Enabling the stream option allows users who may be gaming aficionados to stream their live gameplay directly to their preferred outlet (eg. YouTube). The settings to allow streaming (eg. login information) can be initially set up/changed by pressing the ‘configure settings’ button which will pull up the form containing the relevant credentials.</p>

                    <p>In order to stream to twitch.tv, the player must first input their stream key using an input box and an onscreen keyboard. The input box could be styled like the one below and be clickable to open the on-screen keyboard. Once the stream key has been verified, the streaming option can be toggled in the options menu and the game will automatically begin broadcasting their gameplay.</p>

                <div class="page-content">
                    <p>The inventory is an interactive icon that is always located at the top right corner of the player’s view unless they are interacting with their inventory. When a player wishes to open their inventory, they must raise their right hand so it hovers over the Inventory icon and press the ‘Select’ button. This opens a 4x4 grid of inventory objects that have been collected so far. Players may use the trackpad to scroll through and highlight desired objects but hovering over the object in 3D space using the controller will also highlight it. Once the desired object is highlighted, the user may press select, which then restores the inventory back to the top right corner while the selected object appears in front of the player. In the case that there are more than 16 objects, the trackpad can be used to scroll to the next page of the inventory.</p>
                    <p>An item that can have quantity greater than 1, such as having multiple skip credits, should be represented by a small number in the bottom right corner of the item’s slot in the inventory. This number should be visible and change with the quantity of the item. An item that is consumable, again like credits, should have a small popup box telling the user what the item does when they select it, and ask the user to “Confirm” or “Close”. The confirm option can be modified to suit the particular item, such as substituting “Use Skip Credit”. The close option will simply cancel the action and close the popup box. Upon confirming the action, the user should be given a form of feedback, the item count reduced in their inventory or removed if none are left,  and the popup box closed.</p>
                    <p>Any interactable and moveable item encountered by a player can be placed in their inventory. Did they find a key but not know what lock to use it on? In the interim, while they figure it out, the key can be placed in inventory. Players may also wish to place items that they believe may be useful in future levels in their inventory so that they may later have access to them.</p>

These behave according to the design of the inventory and have the customized options “Add Room Time” and “Skip Next Puzzle”. This feature must be enabled by the user in the options menu, and in that section is a further description about skip credits.</p>

The user must also press the trigger or ‘interact’ button while doing so.</p>
