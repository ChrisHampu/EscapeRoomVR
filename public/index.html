                    <p>Story mode is composed of a set of sequential room challenges to complete. The rooms become more difficult as each one is completed. What’s more, items collected in earlier rooms may be needed in order to complete later challenges. Players may move backwards through rooms without having to re-do the previous challenges.They may not evidently, move forward without completing the current challenge.</p>
                    <p>Within each room, a procedural series of actions must be performed in order to escape. When each of these milestones is completed, this progress is saved, in addition to the current state of the player’s inventory, which tracks the items they have collected up to that point.When the game is exited and then it is restored, it will return to the point immediately following the completion of the most recent milestone.These milestone steps can be skipped (auto completed by the game) , advancing the game, through the expenditure of credits (see Options).When these steps are completed, nothing is seen on the user’s end.They do not get to understand the puzzle solving aspects of the portion they have skipped over; the necessary steps to complete that subtask are simply completed and the items that would have been collected appear in the player’s inventory.</p>

                <div class="page-content">
                    <p>Puzzle mode allows the user to choose from a set of  puzzle rooms, different from those in story mode, to solve. Each of these rooms is designed to be able to be completed independently; all puzzle rooms are mutually exclusive in that no item other than those loaded into inventory when the room is launched, are needed to complete it.</p>
                    <p>Puzzle rooms may be played in single or multiplayer mode. Single player puzzle is has a format identical to that of story mode. Multiplayer mode remotely connects players over the internet. Teams of up to five can either be chosen by providing all players’ unique identification, or randomly assigned from a pool of waiting users. The goal of multiplayer mode is not to engender competition but to encourage collaboration ; the setup of the rooms is the same as single player mode and therefore, every milestone action can only be completed once. This format means that there is no support for competitive gameplay. All players on a team share an inventory and must work together to escape the room.</p>

                <p>Puzzles are timed, and each time the player completes a room, the time they took is recorded in a local leaderboard if they did not skip any puzzles. Leaderboards can be accessed through the Options menu, and shows the five fastest completion times for each room. From here, the player may view a global leaderboard and choose to add their own best times to the global leaderboard. This gives players a reward for completing puzzles without skipping them and lets them compete with other players.</p>

                    <p>If the player selects ‘Options’ , the startup menu is replaced by a secondary options menu with the possible selections: brightness, sound, credits, and stream. The first two are incremental sliders while the latter two are simple on/off toggle switches. Below the stream switch is an option button ‘configure streaming’. If the settings for streaming have not been initially set, the game will not allow the user to toggle streaming ‘on’.</p>
                    <p>The brightness option allows the user to adjust the brightness if the screen and the sound slider allows the user to adjust the volume level between mute and max volume.</p>
                    <p>The volume option will allow the user to adjust how loud the game volume is. This is a global option for all of the sounds within the game: background, interactions, and any other sounds available.</p>
                    <o>Enabling the use of credits permits the user to use credits to bypass steps in a given room to hasten its completion, or to extend the allocated time limit by 30 second increments. Credits are earned automatically upon the completion of rooms, but can also be purchased with real money through the game’s website. All the user has to do is log in using their unique player id (See streaming) and provide a method of payment. Credits reside in the player’s inventory. Credits earned through the completion of Story mode challenges may only be then in turn used in story mode ; the same is true of Puzzle mode credits.</p>
                    <p>Enabling the stream option allows users who may be gaming aficionados to stream their live gameplay directly to their preferred outlet (eg. YouTube). The settings to allow streaming (eg. login information) can be initially set up/changed by pressing the ‘configure settings’ button which will pull up the form containing the relevant credentials.</p>
